1)	What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
Abstract contains only virtual functions which have no implementations, while concrete class always have full implementation of its behaviors, which have its member variable and defined member function.
2)	Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?
void display(std::ostream&) const;
3)	Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
I have learn how to use virtual and pure virtual functions, how to code abstract base class and understand the different abstract base class and concrete class 


	Quiz 7 Reflection
1, When do we call a class as abstract class?  
When a base class have one or more pure virtual function we call it abstract class

3)	Write True / False for the followings
