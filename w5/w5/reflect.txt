1. The perator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
We do not want to return reference to an object because we only need to return the value not the alias to the object.
2.	List the temporary objects in the w5_at_home.cpp main module.
3.	Line 52. (a + b).display(); line 56. (b + d).display(); line 60. (b += d).display();
4.	List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize code dupli-cation.  Answer: setEmpty() to initialize the object to value that represent a safe empty state.
5.	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I have learn how to overload operator as a member function of a class, ac-cess the current object from within a member function and identify a tem-porary object.
