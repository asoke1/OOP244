1.	What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.
I put template functions in Data.ccp  and it did not work. The compile gave me error that the definition was not fund.
2.	Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()?
Template declarations are only permitted at global, namespace, or class scope.
3.	Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates? 
No, compiler will complain because the functions would have two different data type.
4.	Are the following equivalent? 
template<class T> 
template<typename T> 
The two are data types.
