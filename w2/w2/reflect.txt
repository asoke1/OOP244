Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory?
We allocate new dynamic memory because an array uses bytes tore data, we increase the size of an array and need to allocate memory to store the increments.

2)	The Kingdom structure stores the name of the kingdom in an array of char-acters. At the end of the program, we do not use the delete operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the name itself. Why donâ€™t we need to use the delete e operator on this array itself? 
W dont need to delete because we do not allocate dynamic for it.

3)	There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the compiler know which definition to call from your main function? 

The compiler identifies overloading functions by their parameter list and generate a new name for each function

4)	Describe what have you have learned in this workshop.
I have learn how to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for an array of elements, learn how to overload functions.
