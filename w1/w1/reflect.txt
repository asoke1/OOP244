1.	What is a namespace? Explain its purpose. 
Namespace is a scope for entities that is encloses. Its used to avoid identifier clashes across different namespace.
2.	Why are header files needed? Explain.
Header file contains functions prototypes and class definitions, while the implementation file contains the logics and function definitions. The header file is needed to separate the implementation from the interface
3.	In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but not the .h files. Explain why you don’t compile header files.
Because the compile can only compile the .cpp file which contain the im-plementations while header file is include for reference. Example is #include “tools.h”
4.	Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file.
Because implementation file does not include another implementation file but can include many header file when is needed.
5.	Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.
I have learnt how to set up the program into modules, how to add compila-tion safeguards to modules and how to use namespaces.
