         REFLECTION

1)	Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else?
The copy assignment delete data from the current object, if object a = a will delete the data from the object we copy from
2)	List examples of how you avoided code duplication.
I created this functions to perform a specific task. bool isValidPhone(const long long phone) const; and void init(const Contact& obj);
3)	List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
I have learn how to define copy constructor, copy assignment, overload operator and to create a class that use dynamic memory.
