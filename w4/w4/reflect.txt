1)	What is a safe empty state? Could you define a safe empty state that differs from the empty state that you defined?
Safe empty state is initialize an object to a value that identify the object as an empty state 
2)	Identify the parts of your source code where to minimized code duplica-tion.
I created 4 private member functions setEmpty() to set object to safe empty state, copyString() to copy string name and destination where needed, vali-date() to validate dates, validatString() to validate string names.
3)	The canTravelWith(...) member function accesses the private data of the object referenced in its parameter. Explain why C++ allows this access.
It can because is a member function of the class. The referenced in this function object is an instance of the same class
4)	What statement did you add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function exe-cutes correctly?
5)	Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I Have learn how to minimize code, define a constructor that initializes an object's data at creation time and also define a default constructor
